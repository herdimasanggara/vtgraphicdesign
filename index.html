        - Class exercise for the rest, <i>Texture Collection</i>. On a 1500 × 1500 pixel file, using Photoshop or Illustrator (or a combination of both), create a texture based on your current collection. At the end of the class, you need to have at
        least 5 different textures in total. Play around with Photoshop’s Filters and Illustrator’s Effects in particular to achieve unexpected outcomes. The results need to be abstract and don’t imply any images. After you finish with them, save
        them as .jpg, put them into one folder, compress the folder, and then send it to herdimas@vt.edu.<br><br>

              <a>
                For this assignment I would like you to begin a new collection of something. It should be something physical and man-made, and ideally it should have a particular visual quality that intrigues you. It will help if your object is not
                overly complex (does not have too many component parts) and is relatively cheap to collect and/or easy to document (if it is large or environmental).<br><br>Some examples include: ticket stubs, joints, key holes, wheels, pens,
                cardboard boxes, postcards, bottles, buttons, receipts, bricks, arches, road signs, etc. Simpler items tend to make for more rewarding investigations. If you select an item that is fairly complex and multifaceted like a shoe, focus on
                just one small part of it, and perhaps a part that you are less familiar with.<br><br>As your collection grows, become attuned to the similarities and differences among your specimens and aim for a wide variety.<br><br>For the next
                class, document at least 6 collection specimens in 3 different ways so that you have 18 images total (3 sets of 6 images). Print your images on 8.5" × 11" paper, 2 images per page (this will give you 9 pages total), and insert these
                pages into your 3-ring binder.<br><br>The goal is to decide on a method of documentation that best reveals the qualities within the object that you are interested in. This will vary depending on your object, but here are some means
                you might consider: xeroxing to highlight shape and contour, scanning (enlarging?) to reveal very precise detail, making a rubbing to emphasize texture, or using a camera if your object is large and/or environmental. If primarily
                using a camera, consider photographing your objects from different angles, at different times of day, or under different lighting conditions.<br><br>Lastly, write a short statement (approximately 200 words) explaining your interest in
                the collection you are starting. Print the statement on 8.5" × 11" paper and add it to your binder.

        public, 4) private, 5) organic, 6) artificial. At the end of the class, you will acquire 6 pictures that you have to edit in Photoshop (using Brightness/Contrast, Sharpen, and/or Levels) to adjust their tonal values to your liking. After you

On 1500 × 1500 pixel files, using only Illustrator tools and limited to black and white, draw a) a self-portrait and b) your friend. You can only use your mouse/mousepad (using drawing stylus is forbidden). Instead of making a realistic drawing of yourself/your friend, try to draw them based on your own aesthetic sensibility and try to incorporate Illustrator effects into the drawing. Aim for unexpected discovery of Illustrator's tools, because the less you know about Illustrator, the better the outcome. After you finish with them, export them as .png or .jpg, put them into one folder, compress the folder, and then send it to herdimas@vt.edu.<br><br>

        - Class exercise for the rest, <i>Re-edit/Re-order</i>. Find 3 different publications (i.e. flyer, poster, newsletter, pamphlet, etc.) about a subject of current importance in Blacksburg which is of particular interest to you. It should not be commercial but rather in the political, social, or cultural realm. After carefully examining its contents (words, images, symbols, textures, etc), reconsider the hierarchy of information based on what, in your opinion, communicates the content in a more effective, succinct, and powerful manner. You can edit the content for clarity’s sake and style (i.e. you may deem it desirable to simplify a call to action like ‘call 203 654 6974 for more information’ to simply listing the number), but do not omit critical information that would impair it’s functionality or change the nature of the event (i.e. if a flyer is annoucing a screening of 4 films, don’t change it to 2, or change the names of the films). Using a simple editing program such as Microsoft Word or Text Edit, list all of the content (textual information) your poster will include from most to least important, and print this out on an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper (this list of content should not be designed, we’re only concerned with the hierarchy of information at this stage).

        - Introduce <div class="project">Project 04.1, Design as Identity</div>. Imagining that your personal collection will be exhibited in a museum, create an identity system through a series of progressive steps. Begin by carefully studying your collection and re-examining your initial statement. What are the underlying themes and aesthetic characteristics, what drew you to your subject? Select 5 adjectives that for you define the meaning, tone, and substance of your collection (examples include words like circular, detailed, mysterious, shiny, everyday, symbolic, soft, unique, monochrome, playful, standard, ornate, etc.). Your list of words should be compelling and as specific to your collection as they can be. Next, create a list of at least 5 possible titles for your collection. Naming is a creative act and an integral part of branding so consider your titles carefully; their length, opportunities for wordplay, their sound, attitude, even the visual shape of the word(s) can be distinctive.<br><br>
        <u>Next week?</u><br>
        - Bring 5 adjectives, 5 titles, and new 20 images of your collection<br>

            - In-class small groups critique<br>
            - Introduce <div class="project">Project 04.2, Type Lock-Up<br></div>. Begin the design of your identity system by creating a ‘type lock-up’ for your collection title. Start this process by searching for suitable typefaces. Think about how the formal graphic qualities of the type itself relate to your key attributes (already begun in the first part of this assignment) and select 5 different typefaces, setting your collection title in each. Now shift your attention to how the arrangement/composition of the words in your title affects their meaning, thinking back to the first assignment where you learned how to communicate ideas through composition alone. For each typeface you have selected, create a different typographic arrangment; experiment with the use of all uppercase letters, all lowercase, mixing the two, emphasizing different words through changes in scale, spacing, placement, etc. As you experiment, refer back to your collection’s key words and ask yourself whether your design is communicating their meaning. Your design does not need to speak to all your key words, you may decide to prioritize those you feel are the most important or inherently visual. Additionally, look at the visual source material you’ve collected. Of the more strictly graphic images, consider what (if any) shapes or textures might be intergrated into your type lock-up, either as elements in addition to the type (surrounding, interacting with), or as part of the type itself. Lastly, keep in mind that logos, logotypes, and type lock-ups generally work best when they are relatively simple. You are not creating an illustrative image but rather a reductive, symbolic mark that can be effective both large and small. Work only in black and white.<br><br>
            <u>Next week?</u><br>
            - Print your 5 type lock-ups on separate 8.5 × 11” sheets of paper, 1 per page, and include the name of each typeface used<br>
