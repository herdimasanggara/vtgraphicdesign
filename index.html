    Martin Luther King Jr. Day<br><hr>

    - Class overview<br>
    - Work samples (available on our Canvas under Files)<br>
    - Instagram accounts: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/metahaven/">Metahaven</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sulki_and_min/">Sulki and Min</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/other_means/">Other Means</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/studiolin/">Studio Lin</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mmparisdotcom/?hl=en">M/M Paris</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/screensaviors/">Screen Saviors</a><br>
    - Class exercise, <i>Narrating A Story</i>. Pick one photograph from "Writing Exercise" under File on Canvas and make a persuasive 300-word story in regards to the chosen photograph.<br>
    - Introduce <div class="dropdown"><div class="project">Project 01, Personal Collection<div class="dropdown_item">
    <a>Collect images to create 7 separate collection. Each collection must comprise at least 6 individual items.<br><br>You may find these items already grouped in one image (e.g. shoes from the page of a fashion catalog), or you might group items from disparate sources to make a new collection according to your own criteria. What constitutes a collection is determined by you and should reflect your interest.<br><br>Print out or glue down each collection on 8.5" x 11" sheet of paper so that you have 7 sheets total, one page per collection. They can be color or black & white and their presentation should be neat but straightforward - our interest for the moment is in the images, not the way they are presented.<br><br>Label the collections on the reverse side of the page and insert them in a standard three-ring binder (at least 1-inch thick), either by three-hole punching them or by inserting them into plastic sleeves (you will continue to add to this binder for the rest of the class).<br><br>Have your collections reflect your interests and look for thematic links. Aim for diversity in subjects and their media sources. <div class="highlight">This is due by next Monday on Jan. 24th at the latest.</div></a>
    </div></div></div><br><br>
    <u>Next week?</u><br>
    - The presentation will be split into 2 days, but I'm going to randomly select 9 people who will go first on Monday. Be prepared to provide your reasoning why these images intrigue you.</span></div>
