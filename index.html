    Martin Luther King Jr. Day<br><hr>
    <center>Jan. 19th</center><br>
    - Class overview<br>
    - Work samples (available on our Canvas under Files)<br>
    - Instagram accounts: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/metahaven/">Metahaven</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sulki_and_min/">Sulki and Min</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/other_means/">Other Means</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/studiolin/">Studio Lin</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mmparisdotcom/?hl=en">M/M Paris</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/screensaviors/">Screen Saviors</a><br>
    - Class exercise, <i>Narrating A Story</i>. Pick one photograph from "Writing Exercise" under File on Canvas and make a persuasive 300-word story in regards to the chosen photograph.<br>
    - Introduce <div class="dropdown"><div class="project">Project 01, Personal Collection<div class="dropdown_item">
    <a>Collect images to create 7 separate collection. Each collection must comprise at least 6 individual items.<br><br>You may find these items already grouped in one image (e.g. shoes from the page of a fashion catalog), or you might group items from disparate sources to make a new collection according to your own criteria. What constitutes a collection is determined by you and should reflect your interest.<br><br>Print out or glue down each collection on 8.5" × 11" sheet of paper so that you have 7 sheets total, one page per collection. They can be color or black & white and their presentation should be neat but straightforward - our interest for the moment is in the images, not the way they are presented.<br><br>Label the collections on the reverse side of the page and insert them in a standard three-ring binder (at least 1-inch thick), either by three-hole punching them or by inserting them into plastic sleeves (you will continue to add to this binder for the rest of the class).<br><br>Have your collections reflect your interests and look for thematic links. Aim for diversity in subjects and their media sources. <div class="highlight">This is due by next Monday on Jan. 24th at the latest.</div></a>
    </div></div></div><br><br>
    <u>Next week?</u><br>
    - The presentation will be split into 2 days, but I'm going to randomly select 9 people who will go first on Monday. Be prepared to provide your reasoning why these images intrigue you.</span></div>

          </center><br>
          - In-class critique for 9 people<br>
          - Class exercise for the rest, <i>Texture Collection</i>. On a 500 x 500 pixel file, using Photoshop or Illustrator (or a combination of both), create a texture based on your current collection. At the end of the class, you need to have at least 7 different textures in total. Play around with Photoshop’s Filters and Illustrator’s Effects in particular to achieve unexpected outcomes. The results need to be abstract and don’t imply any images. After you finish with it, save them as .jpg, put them into one folder, compress the folder, and then send it to herdimas@vt.edu.<br><br>
          <u>Next Thursday?</u><br>
          - Continuing the in-class critique for the 2nd group<hr>
          <center>Jan. 26th</center><br>
          - In-class critique for the remaining 9 people<br>
          - Class exercise (<i>Texture Collection</i>) for the 9 people who already presented on Monday<br>
          - Introduce <div class="dropdown"><div class="project">Project 01.1, Personal Collection (Observation)<div class="dropdown_item">
          <a>
            For this assignment I would like you to begin a new collection of something. It should be something physical and man-made, and ideally it should have a particular visual quality that intrigues you. It will help if your object is not overly complex (does not have too many component parts) and is relatively cheap to collect and/or easy to document (if it is large or environmental).<br><br>Some examples include: ticket stubs, joints, key holes, wheels, pens, cardboard boxes, postcards, bottles, buttons, receipts, bricks, arches, road signs, etc. Simpler items tend to make for more rewarding investigations. If you select an item that is fairly complex and multifaceted like a shoe, focus on just one small part of it, and perhaps a part that you are less familiar with.<br><br>As your collection grows, become attuned to the similarities and differences among your specimens and aim for a wide variety.<br><br>For the next class, document at least 6 collection specimens in 3 different ways so that you have 18 images total (3 sets of 6 images). Print your images on 8.5" × 11" paper, 2 images per page (this will give you 9 pages total), and insert these pages into your 3-ring binder.<br><br>The goal is to decide on a method of documentation that best reveals the qualities within the object that you are interested in. This will vary depending on your object, but here are some means you might consider: xeroxing to highlight shape and contour, scanning (enlarging?) to reveal very precise detail, making a rubbing to emphasize texture, or using a camera if your object is large and/or environmental. If primarily using a camera, consider photographing your objects from different angles, at different times of day, or under different lighting conditions.<br><br>Lastly, write a short statement (approximately 200 words) explaining your interest in the collection you are starting. Print the statement on 8.5" × 11" paper and add it to your binder.
